Private Set Intersection Library
================================

Increasing dependence on anytime-anywhere availability of data and the increasing fear of losing privacy

a server and a client, need to privately compute an intersection of their respective sets of data.
In doing so, one or both parties must obtain the intersection, while neither should learn any additional information.
